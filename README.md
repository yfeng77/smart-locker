FAU Senior Design Showcase - <strong>FAU Smart Lockers</strong>

Sponsored by: Florida Atlantic University S.E. Wimberly Library

Created with the pandemic in mind, our goal is to reduce the amount of physical contact when picking up material from the S.E. Wimberly Library’s lockers. Working with the Library’s Director of University Computing Systems, we designed prototypes of contactless locks that will serve as replacements for the current locks which require being physically touched to open. Community Benefit: The lock mechanism replacement will reduce the amount of physical contact involved and improve workflow and functionality for library staff.
